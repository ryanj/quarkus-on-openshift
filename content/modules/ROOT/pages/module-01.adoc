In this track, you will get an introduction to [Quarkus](https://quarkus.io).

What you need to know before you start:

In order to get full benefit from taking this track you should...<br>• Have experience programming applications in Java using the [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) framework.<br>• Understand how Maven uses the Project Object Model (POM) to manage artifacts and plugins.<br>• Know how Maven applications are described and built using a Maven [`pom.xml`](https://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-the-pom.html) file.

= What is Quarkus?

Quarkus is a Kubernetes Native Java stack tailored for [GraalVM](https://www.graalvm.org/) and [OpenJDK HotSpot](https://openjdk.java.net/groups/hotspot/). Quarkus is also crafted from the best of breed Java libraries and standards. Amazingly fast boot time, incredibly low RSS memory (not just heap size!) offering near instant scale up and high density memory utilization in container orchestration platforms like Kubernetes. Quarkus uses a technique called compile time boot. [Learn more](https://quarkus.io/vision/container-first).

Quarkus maximizes the Developer Productivity with the following features:
* [Zero-config Live coding](https://quarkus.io/guides/maven-tooling#dev-mode/)
* [Dev Services](https://quarkus.io/guides/dev-services)
* [Continuous testing](https://quarkus.io/guides/continuous-testing)
* [Dev UI](https://quarkus.io/guides/dev-ui)
* [Command Line Interface (CLI)](https://quarkus.io/guides/cli-tooling)
* [Remote Development](https://quarkus.io/guides/maven-tooling#remote-development-mode)

Application requirements have changed over the last few years. For any application to succeed in the era of big data, IoT or cloud computing, adhering to the principles and practices of the [reactive architecture style](https://developers.redhat.com/coderland/reactive/reactive-intro) is essential.


= Writing your lab

== Variables

The `lab_name` var, known as an asciidoc attribute, is set in `site.yml` and can be used to set the lab_name (Example: {lab_name}) or title of your content.
They are both free to change its value and if you prefer to use a different var name, you can change the value of `lab_name`, for example to `title` in `site.yml` and then reference it in your content as `\{site-title}` (Ex: {site-title}).

Example:
[source,asciidoc]
----
{my_var}
----

Variable rendered:

{my_var}

== Inserting Images

To display an image in your Antora documentation, place the image file in the `assets/images/` folder of the module, then reference it using the `image::[]` macro

=== Basic Syntax

[source,asciidoc]
----
image::example-image.png[Example Image, width=100, height=100]
----

This will render the `example-image.png` image as it follows:

image::example-image.png[Example Image, width=100, height=100]

=== Understanding the Antora Configuration

This lab explains the purpose and structure of the YAML configuration used in an Antora-based documentation site.

=== Basic Structure

The configuration is written in YAML `ui-config.yml` and includes two main sections: `antora` and `tabs`. Click next to know more.
