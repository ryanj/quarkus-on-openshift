= Writing your lab

== Variables

The `lab_name` var, known as an asciidoc attribute, is set in `site.yml` and can be used to set the lab_name (Example: {lab_name}) or title of your content.
They are both free to change its value and if you prefer to use a different var name, you can change the value of `lab_name`, for example to `title` in `site.yml` and then reference it in your content as `\{site-title}` (Ex: {site-title}).

Example:
[source,asciidoc]
----
{my_var}
----

Variable rendered:

{my_var}

== Inserting Images

To display an image in your Antora documentation, place the image file in the `assets/images/` folder of the module, then reference it using the `image::[]` macro

=== Basic Syntax

[source,asciidoc]
----
image::example-image.png[Example Image, width=100, height=100]
----

This will render the `example-image.png` image as it follows:

image::example-image.png[Example Image, width=100, height=100]

=== Understanding the Antora Configuration
